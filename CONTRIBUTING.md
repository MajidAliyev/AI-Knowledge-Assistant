# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to help! Here's how to get set up.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Run `./install.sh` to set everything up
4. Make your changes
5. Test that it works
6. Open a pull request

## Code Style

- Python: follow PEP 8 (use a formatter if you want)
- JavaScript/React: I use ESLint/Prettier but don't stress too much
- Write clear commit messages
- Add comments if you're doing something tricky

## Testing

Before you submit a PR, make sure:
- Backend starts without errors
- Frontend builds
- Features work as expected
- No console errors

## Questions?

Just open an issue and ask. No stupid questions.
